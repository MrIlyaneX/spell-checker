For example, the phrase \"dking sport\" should be fixed as \"doing sport\" not \"dying sport\", while \"dking species\" -- as \"dying species\".\n",

        "I used following idea: \n",
        "\n",
        "- per each single word we can find it's _corrections_. By _corrections_ I mean finding the words into wich the word could be changed (based on data of unigrams I collect). By doing so, I will retrieve some top-k words that could be 'derived' by correcting the word: most probably the _true_ word will be in the top-k ones, even if the initial word is correct (but I assume that the wrong words a those that not included in _vocab_ that model was buid on).\n",
        "\n",
        "- Using NGram Language Model, pick one word from top-k ones, chosen in prev. step (with some number of surrounding words) and compute the probabilities that model gives for the chosen word to be in the sentence. Pick the best word based on highest probability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Potentially these actions could be vectorized, so some speed-up could be gain.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What I need to implement\n",
        "\n",
        "- Collect unigrams for single word spell corrector\n",
        "- Collect NGrams for Ngram LM\n",
        "- Unigram corrector: \n",
        "    - Distance to see 'similarity' words (it could be named differently)\n",
        "- NGram LM:\n",
        "    - Train the model on the data\n",

        "    - 'Correctness' of spellcheking\n",
        "    - 'Time' used for the algorithm\n",
        "\n",
        "### Difficulties\n",
        "\n",
        "The 'top-k' approach with the general distance computation for pairs of words (even with possible improvements) work quite slowly. I see the only way to fix it: use the other way of singe-word-correction\n",
        "\n",
        "My implementation does not handle _wrong word by meaning_, since I check for words to correct initially based on grammar / syntax, then I pick the most suitable word using NLM predictions  \n",
        "\n",
        "### What and Why I have used\n",
        "\n",
        "Word change distance: \n",
        "\n",
        "As I know, three main algorithms used: Levenshtein, Damerauâ€“Levenshtein and Optimal String Allignment (OSA).\n",
        "Other algortithms, like Hamming distance, etc. seem to be used in some specifiec scenarios, not the general spelling correction.\n",
        "\n",
        "My idea was to use an algorithm, that is capable of fixing 3+ mistaken letter, therefore I used Damerauâ€“Levenshtein (but it's quite computation expensive)\n",
        "\n",
        "The Damerauâ€“Levenshtein:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Insert / Delete / Swap operations, as in Levenshtein distance or in OSA\n",
        "- Transpositions (or order swap of characters)\n",
        "    - Adjacent transposition: adjacent characters in word swapped positions - typo fix (as in OSA)\n",
        "    - Overlapping transposition: handle cases with keyboard misstyping - only the Damerauâ€“Levenshtein supports it\n",
        "- The algorithm is about _O(mn)_, but it could be speeded up using tree-based structures to about _O(m log n)_ comlexity (not implemented)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The Damerauâ€“Levenshtein distance is optimised by early stopping by max edit distance:\n",
        "\n",
        "- In some way, the Norvig approach is faster thanks to 2-edit based words, since the number of comparisons \\ operations is in magnitude lower, but with the cases of higher changes / transposes Norvig does no work, while distance calculation works\n",
        "\n",
        "My solution is quite slow compared to the Norvig on larger sentences (moreover, I use in some sense 1-2-3-4-5 gram models implicinty by creating paddings), but my optimisations slightly speeded-up the algorithm\n",
        "\n",
        "The _top_k_ parameter increase does not signigicanly slows the model's performance, this increases the overall generalization of the model's corrections (sometimes it's more like an word changer)  \n",

        "Algorithm is capable of correcting multiple words in sentence\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Ngram Language Models\n",
        "\n",
        "For Ngram Language Model I used rough estimating of probabilities, since building matrix of ngram, as we usually made is too memory-consuming for such large vocablurary size: the ordinaty solution to create matrix is generally impossible for n>3, as more than 18GB RAM needed (tested this to compare RAM usage of approaches). Even bigram table uses near 8GB RAM with these data, while dicrionary-based 2 and 5 gram models need less than 800MB of RAM.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "I do not clean data in sense, that stopwords (that usually removed) could be used to correct. Moreover, I assumed to  lowercase all words, since small number of original words is capitalized (but mostly vocab I use is lowercased, this might be some issue) and therefore I will get high number of 'unk tokens' for predictions\n",
        "\n",
        "##### I used the bigrams, fivegrams dataset from moodle\n",
